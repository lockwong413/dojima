# ⚒ Dojima

![](https://i.imgur.com/NXNuEpB.png)

**Dojima** is a command line tool to convert NetImmerse / Gamebryo `NIF` files from the game « _Way of the Samurai 4_ » to `glTF 2.0`.

#### Features

- [x] mesh hierarchy (*Characters*),
- [x] float16 buffers (*Maps, Items, Accessories & Weapons*),
- [x] materials,
- [ ] bones,
- [ ] skeletal animation,
- [ ] facial animation,
- [ ] extra properties.

### Quick start

```bash
# Clone the project.
git clone https://github.com/tcoppex/dojima

# Compile using Ninja as generator (optional).
cmake dojima -B BUILD/dojima -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build BUILD/dojima

# Run the cli converter.
#./dojima/bin/nif2gltf $WOTS4_PATH/Common/Character/Model/Pack/Dojima01.nif
```

## Notes

Using `niflib` as nif reader is probably overkill but might be changed later on.

### Notes on WotS4 data layout

In Resources/Character, `Part` defined single nif mesh object whereas `Pack` defined
the whole model (minus animation data).

WOTS4 has 3 kind of datastream :
    * INDEX
    * ATTRIBUTES (Texcoord, Position, Normal, Binormal, Tangent, BlendIndice, BlendWeight)
    * BONE_PALETTE

#### Models Packs.

first block is a IntegerExtraData (supposedly an id).

Then on the root, each parts are described by 4 root block :
  
  1- a `StringExtraData` to the mesh part.

  2- An upper `Node` for internal structure.
   * Internally they have the following rendering properties:
    - StringExtraData (creation info)
    - ZBufferProperty
    - ShadeProperty (smooth or not)
    - VertexColorProperty
    - MaterialProperty
   
   * Then a node with internally two elements :
    - first contain the rig hierarchy (supposedly, to detail)
      + First node is a transformController (to move)
      + Second is the root node of the rig.
    - second is a SwitchNode for LOD (higher level lower quality).
  
  3- a `StringExtraData` to the part's texture name / path.

  4- a `PixelData` describing (containing ?) the part's texture data.
